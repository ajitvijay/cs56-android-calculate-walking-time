### Current Progress (what we accomplished) 
1. When the application opens, it opens with the current location set to UCSB on the map (using Google Maps API)
2. Two spinners are shown on top 
3. Each of these spinners contains a drop down of 5-6 UCSB classroom locations 
4. If you select a classroom on one of these spinners, the location of that classroom will be displayed on the map 
5. A "calculate" button is present - this button should be able to calculate the walking time between two different classrooms on the two spinners, 
then the app should display this walking time in some method 

### Current User Flow (what we accomplished) 
1. The user opens up the applications
2. A map is displayed with the location set to UCSB 
3. The user can now either simply display a classroom, by choosing it from the spinner list. 

### Ideas for the future
